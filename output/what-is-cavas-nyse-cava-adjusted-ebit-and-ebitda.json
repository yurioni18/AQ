  "title": "What is Cava's (NYSE: CAVA) adjusted EBIT and EBITDA for the fiscal year ending in 2023? Make sure to factor operating and variable lease related line items. Use ratios to approximate any lease related line items that are not explicitly reported. Show answer in millions and with no decimal point precision.",
  "description": "1) Identify fiscal year and sources: CAVA’s fiscal year ended December 31, 2023; use FY2023 earnings press release and FY2023 Form 10-K to source Adjusted EBITDA, depreciation and amortization (D&A), and lease-cost components.\n \n 2) Record FY2023 Adjusted EBITDA: $73,825 thousand ($73.825 million).\n \n 3) Record FY2023 depreciation and amortization: $47,433 thousand ($47.433 million).\n \n 4) Verify operating and variable lease costs are included in operating results: FY2023 operating lease cost $44,201 thousand and variable lease cost $1,421 thousand (classified within occupancy and G&A), plus pre-opening lease cost $4,296 thousand (within pre-opening costs); these are not added back in CAVA’s Adjusted EBITDA definition, so EBIT/EBITDA figures already reflect them—no ratio approximations required.\n \n 5) Compute FY2023 Adjusted EBIT by subtracting D&A from Adjusted EBITDA: $73,825 thousand − $47,433 thousand = $26,392 thousand.\n \n 6) Present FY2023 results in USD millions, no decimals (rounded): Adjusted EBIT = $26 million; Adjusted EBITDA = $74 million.",
  "answer": "Adjusted EBIT = \"$26 million\" \n Adjusted EBITDA = \"$74 million\"",
