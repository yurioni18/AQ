  "description": "Step 1 – Identify the objective\n Calculate the year-over-year percentage change in gross profit generated from customers in China from FY 2023 to FY 2024. Gross profit is calculated as revenue from China multiplied by AMD’s consolidated gross margin.\n \n Step 2 – Extract consolidated gross margin values from AMD’s FY 2024 Form 10-K\n url :https://ir.amd.com/financial-information/sec-filings/content/0001193125-25-067185/0001193125-25-067185.pdf\n Locate the consolidated gross margin figures for both years.\n FY 2023 gross margin: 46%\n FY 2024 gross margin: 49%\n These margins will be applied directly to China revenue because the question states that China revenue carries AMD’s consolidated gross margin.\n \n Step 3 – Extract China’s nominal GDP values from FRED\n Retrieve the annual nominal GDP for China in current US dollars.\n url :https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MKTGDPCNA646NWDB\n 2023 GDP: 18,270,356,654,533.20\n 2024 GDP: 18,743,803,170,827.20\n \n Step 4 – Calculate China’s nominal GDP growth rate\n Compute the year-over-year growth rate using the GDP numbers.\n Growth rate = (GDP 2024 / GDP 2023) – 1\n Growth rate = (18,743,803,170,827.20 / 18,270,356,654,533.20) – 1\n Growth rate = 0.025913\n China’s nominal GDP growth rate for 2024 is 2.59%.\n This becomes the assumed revenue growth rate for China.\n \n Step 5 – Project FY 2024 revenue from China\n Apply the GDP-based growth rate to FY 2023 revenue from China.\n Revenue 2024 = Revenue 2023 × (1 + 0.025913)\n An exact revenue value is not needed because it cancels out later.\n \n Step 6 – Compute FY 2023 and FY 2024 gross profit from China\n Gross profit 2023 = Revenue 2023 × 0.46\n Gross profit 2024 = Revenue 2023 × (1 + 0.025913) × 0.49\n \n Step 7 – Calculate the year-over-year percentage change in gross profit\n Percent change = (Gross profit 2024 / Gross profit 2023 – 1) × 100\n Percent change = [(1 + 0.025913) × (0.49 / 0.46) – 1] × 100\n Percent change = [1.025913 × 1.065217 – 1] × 100\n Percent change = (1.092821 – 1) × 100\n Percent change = 9.2821%\n \n Step 8 – State the final answer\n Year-over-year percentage change in gross profit generated from China for FY 2024 is 9.28%.",
