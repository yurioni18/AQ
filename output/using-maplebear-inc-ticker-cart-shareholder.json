(ticker: CART) shareholder letters on quarterly and annual results determine the quarter in FY2024 with the largest beat of actual Gross Transaction Value relative guidance. Use midpoints of guidance ranges in your calculations. Format the answer as: \"[X]Q FY 2024, [X.XX] % Beat\"",
  "description": "1) Extract quarterly GTV guidance ranges from quarterly shareholder letters for each quarter of FY2024 (located in the section \"QX’24 Financial Outlook\" of letter):\n Q1: $8000 -$8200M\n Q2: $8000 - $8150M\n Q3: $8100 - $8250M\n Q4: $8500 - $8650M\n \n 2) Calculate midpoints (as sum of lower and upper limit of the guidance range divided by 2):\n Q1: ($8000 +$8200M) /2 = $8100M\n Q2: ( $8000 + $8150M) /2 = $8075M\n Q3: ($8100 + $8250M) /2 = $8175M\n Q4: ($8500 + $8650M) /2 = $8575M\n \n 3) Extract actual quarterly GTVs for each quarter of FY2024:\n 1Q: $8319M\n 2Q: $8194M\n 3Q: $8303M\n 4Q: $8645\n \n 4) Calculate beat/miss relative to midpoint for each Q:\n 1Q: $8319M / $8100M - 1 = 2.7%\n 2Q: $8194M / $8075M -1 = 1.5%\n 3Q: $8303M / $8175M -1 = 1.6%\n 4Q: $8645M / $8575M -1 = 0.8%\n  \n 5) Find the largest value of the beat and determine the number of corresponding quarter. 1Q has the largest beat, so the answer is: \"1Q FY 2024, 2.70 % Beat\"",
