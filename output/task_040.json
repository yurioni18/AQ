Report Adjusted EBITDA margin in % (2 decimals).\n \n CFO before working capital (2024): From the cash flow statement reconciliation, compute Net cash provided by operating activities + (increase)/decrease in net working capital. Report the resulting CFO before WC in $M (2 decimals) and as % of revenue (2 decimals).\n \n Free cash flow & conversion (2024): FCF = CFO − Purchases of property and equipment (treat capex outflows as positive). Report FCF in $M (2 decimals) and FCF/Revenue in % (2 decimals).\n \n Rounding & units: All $ amounts in USD $M with strict trailing zeros to 2 decimals; percentages to 2 decimals with %; ratios in x to 2 decimals. Cite the exact 10-K sections you pull from (e.g., Item 7 MD&A, Item 8 statements, non-GAAP reconciliations, debt footnote, RPO/deferred revenue disclosures)."
