  "description": "To determine the Price to Pre-IFRS 16 Free Cash Flow multiple for FY 2024, use the following formula: FY 2024 Closing Share Price ÷ FY 2024 Pre-IFRS 16 Free Cash Flow per share (defined as \"Free cash flow before new club capex per share\").\n \n Search the Shareholder Information section of Basic-Fit’s 2024 Annual Report to locate the share price at year-end 2024. Record this value as €22.58.\n \n Search the Key Figures subsection in the Business and Financial Review section of the Annual Report to locate \"Free cash flow before new club capex per share\". Record this value as €2.36. Note that this metric is defined in the report as Underlying EBITDA less rent adjusted for maintenance capital expenditures, cash interest, and cash taxes, serving as the correct Pre-IFRS 16 proxy.\n \n Calculate the final multiple:\n €22.58 / €2.36 = 9.5677…\n \n Round to two decimal places to arrive at a final multiple of 9.57.",
