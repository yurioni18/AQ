  "description": "Step 1) Locate total employee headcount\n In the Human Capital Resources of Tesla’s FY 2024 Form 10-K locate the employee headcount as of 2024-12-31. It states, the “employee headcount worldwide was 125,665” employees. This will be the denominator for the calculation. \n \n Step 2) Locate Manufacturing Development Program hires\n In the “Development Programs” subsection of Tesla’s FY 2024 Form 10-K locate the hires as of 2024-12-31. It states, “hired over 800 graduates” \n \n Step 3) Find the Percentage\n Formula is: Percentage = (Program Hires/Total Employees)× 100\n So plugging in the numbers, 800 ÷ 125,665 × 100 = 0.6366%\n \n Step 4) Round to two decimals \n 0.6366% rounds up to 0.64% to fit question criteria.",
