  "title": "Using NVDA’s 10-Ks, answer the following question: In FY2024, NVDA reported that one indirect customer represented 19% of total revenue for the fiscal year. This indirect customer purchased NVDA products through a specific direct customer for which NVDA provided additional disclosure. In FY2025, what percentage of NVDA’s total revenue was attributable to this direct customer?",
  "description": "Identify the direct customer referenced in FY2024: NVIDIA’s FY2024 Form 10-K states that one indirect customer represented approximately 19% of total revenue and primarily purchased through “Customer A.” NVIDIA also disclosed that sales to Customer A represented 13% of FY2024 total revenue (NVIDIA Form 10-K, fiscal year ended January 28, 2024).\n \n Look up FY2025 concentration of revenue: NVIDIA’s FY2025 Form 10-K shows that Direct Customer A represented 12% of total revenue for FY2025 (fiscal year ended January 26, 2025). Customer B represented 11%, and Customer C represented 11%. Note that both Customers A and C represented less than 10% of total revenue in FY2024, so neither can be the FY2024 10-K’s Customer A.\n \n Conclude that the FY2024 10-K’s Customer A is the FY2025 10-K’s Customer B. This makes sense because in the FY2025 10-K, Customer B is reported to have represented 13% of total revenues in FY2024, which matches the FY2024 disclosure for Customer A.\n \n Customer B represented 11% of total FY2025 revenues.",
