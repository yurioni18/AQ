  "description": "To determine the Underlying Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio for FY 2024, use the following formula: FY 2024 Closing Share Price divided by FY 2024 Diluted Underlying Net Result per Share.\n \n Search the Shareholder Information section of Basic-Fit’s 2024 Annual Report to locate the share price at year-end 2024. Record this value as €22.58.\n \n Search the Key Figures section of the Annual Report to locate the Diluted Underlying Net Result per Share. Record this value as €0.65. Ensure you use the diluted figure which adjusts for exceptional items and potential share dilution, based on the Underlying Net Result of €43.6 million.\n \n Calculate the final ratio: €22.58 / €0.65 = 34.7384…\n \n Round to two decimal places to arrive at a final ratio of 34.74.",
