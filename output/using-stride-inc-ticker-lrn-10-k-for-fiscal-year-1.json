  "description": "1. Find enrollments for FY2025 and FY2024 from the FY2025 10-K Enrollment Data table (located in MD&A section) for Career Learning business segment: \n FY2025 = 96.3 thousand; \n FY2024 = 72.7 thousand.\n \n 2. Extract the number of schools/programs where School-as-a-Service was provided in the Career Learning market for each corresponding school year (located in \"ITEM 1.

Compute enrollment per school for each year by dividing enrollment by number of schools: \n FY2025 = 96,300 ÷ 56 = 1,719.64 students per school \n FY2024 = 72,700 ÷ 56 = 1,298.21 students per school.\n \n 4. Calculate YoY % change of enrollment per school from FY2024 to FY2025:\n  [(1,719.64 − 1,298.21) ÷ 1,298.21] × 100 = 32.46%",
