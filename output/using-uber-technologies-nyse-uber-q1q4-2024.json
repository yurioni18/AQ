  "description": "1. Find the midpoint EBITDA guidance in each quarter in 2024 by looking at the earnings press release from the prior quarter, then compare to the actual adjusted EBITDA in the earnings release in the desired quarter.\n \n 1. Q1 2024: Use Q4 2023 guidance range $1.26B–$1.34B = midpoint $1.30B; compare to Q1 actual Adjusted EBITDA $1,382M; Beat% = (1,382−1,300)/1,300 = 6.31%: Q1 2024: BEAT (6.31%).\n \n 2. Q2 2024: Use Q1 2024 guidance range $1.45B–$1.53B = midpoint $1.49B; compare to Q2 actual Adjusted EBITDA $1,570M; Beat% = (1,570−1,490)/1,490 = 5.37%: Q2 2024: BEAT (5.37%).\n \n 3.
