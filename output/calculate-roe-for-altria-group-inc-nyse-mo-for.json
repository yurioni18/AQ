  "title": "Calculate ROE for Altria Group, INC. (NYSE: MO) for fiscal years 2022 through 2024 by calculating the net profit margin, the total asset turnover, and total leverage. Do not round any value until the ROE, which can be rounded to three decimal places. Use Altria Group, INC.'s 10-Ks for information.",
  "description": "##The formula for ROE using Net Profit Margin, Total Asset Turnover, and Total Leverage is Net Profit Margin*Total Asset Turnover*Total Leverage. The formula for Net Profit Margin is Net Income/Net Sales. The formula for Total Asset Turnover is Net Sales/Average Total Assets. The formula for Total Leverage is Average Total Assets/Average Total Equity. \n \n ##Beginning with Net Profit Margin= Net Income/Net Sales, the calculation for each fiscal year is as follows: \n FY 2022: 5,764 / 25,096\n FY 2023: 8,130 / 24,483\n FY 2024: 11,264 / 24,018\n \n ##In computing Total Asset Turnover= Net Sales/Average Total Assets, the Average Total Assets is the average in Total Assets over a two year period. The results are as follows: \n FY 2022: 25,096 /((36,954 + 39,523) / 2)= 25,096 / 38,238.5\n FY 2023: 24,483/((38,570 + 36,954) / 2)= 24,483 / 37,762.0\n FY 2024: 24,018/((35,177 + 38,570) / 2)= 24,018 / 36,873.5\n \n ##In computing Total Leverage= Average Total Assets/Average Total Equity, the Average Total Equity is the average in Total Equity over a two year period. The results are as follows: \n FY 2022: 38,238.5/((-3,973 + -1,606) / 2)= 38,238.5 / (-2,789.5)\n FY 2023: 37,762.0/((-3,540 + -3,973) / 2)= 37,762.0 / (-3,756.5)\n FY 2024: 36,873.5/( (-2,238 + -3,540) / 2)= 36,873.5 / (-2,889.0)\n \n ##In combining all of the elements for each fiscal year to get to ROE, the calculations are as follows: \n FY 2022: (5,764 / 25,096) × (25,096 / 38,238.5) × (38,238.5 / -2,789.5) = 5,764 / (-2,789.5) = -2.066320129… → -206.632% (rounded to three decimals)\n FY 2023: (8,130 / 24,483) × (24,483 / 37,762.0) × (37,762.0 / -3,756.5) = 8,130 / (-3,756.5) = -2.164248636… → -216.425% (rounded to three decimals)\n FY 2024: (11,264 / 24,018) × (24,018 / 36,873.5) × (36,873.5 / -2,889.0) = 11,264 / (-2,889.0) = -3.8989269… → -389.893% (rounded to three decimals)",
