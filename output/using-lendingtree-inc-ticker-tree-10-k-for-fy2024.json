  "title": "Using LendingTree Inc. (ticker: TREE) 10-K for FY2024 and FRED data on new originations of large bank consumer mortgages, calculate FY2024 operating income of Home segment. Assume y/y % change of home business revenue from FY2023 to FY2024 equal to y/y growth rate of new originations of large bank consumer mortgages (annual, in US$) and home segment operating profit margin equal to conslolidated operating profit margin. Provide the answer in $M, rounded to 1 decimal.",
  "description": "1. Extract FY2023 Home segment revenue from LendingTree’s FY2024 10-K (the value can be found in NOTE 3—REVENUE to consolidated FS): $143.753M\n \n 2. Calculate annual values of “Large Bank Consumer Mortgage Originations: New Originations (RCMFLOORIG)” sourced from FRED as required in the promt by summing quarterly values:\n 2023 = 46.51 + 61.10 + 59.28 + 45.50 = 212.39 \n 2024 = 43.33 + 59.64 + 62.57 + 67.98 = 233.52\n \n 3. Calculate the y/y growth rate of large bank consumer mortgage originations by dividing 2024 value by 2023 value:\n y/y growth = (233.52/212.39) − 1 = 9.9487%.\n \n 4. Calculate FY2024 Home segment revenue using the above growth rate assumption as required in the promt: \n FY2024 Home segment revenue = $143.753M × 1.099487 = $158.0545M.\n \n 4. Calculate consolidated FY2024 operating margin from the FY2024 10-K (values can be found in income statement): Operating income = $44.627M; Total revenue = $900.219M; Operating margin = $44.627M / $900.219M = 4.9573%. \n \n 5. Calculate FY2024 Home segment operating income by applying consolidated margin to the projected Home revenue: $158.0545M × 4.9573% = $7.8353M = $7.8M",
