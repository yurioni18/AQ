Show your full solution; include formulas, calculations, intermediate steps, and assumptions. Do not just pull the data from a financial source, but calculate each metric individually using their respective formulas.",
  "description": "1) Set period, definitions, and formulas used; state assumption clearly.\n - Assumption: Use trailing‑twelve‑months (TTM) ending 2025‑09‑30 because Regal Rexnord’s latest SEC quarterly filing available prior to 2025‑11‑18 is the Q3 2025 Form 10‑Q. EBITDA is computed as GAAP Income from Operations + Depreciation + Amortization; EV = Market Cap + Total Debt + Noncontrolling Interests − Cash; EV/Sales = EV ÷ TTM Sales; EV/EBITDA = EV ÷ TTM EBITDA; P/E = Price (11/18/2025 close) ÷ sum of last four quarterly diluted EPS. (Q3 2025 10‑Q availability and section headings, 2025‑09‑30; 2024 10‑K includes full‑year statements.)\n \n 2) Retrieve the stock price at the specified date and the share count to compute Market Capitalization.\n - Closing price on 2025‑11‑18: $129.99 per share. (Regal Rexnord Corp historical daily table, shows 2025‑11‑18 close = $129.99.) Market data source used only for the price. [Price date: 2025‑11‑18.]\n - Shares outstanding: 66,389,673 common shares outstanding as of 2025‑10‑27 (per cover page note in Q3 2025 10‑Q).\n - Formula and calculation (USD):\n  Market Cap = Price × Shares = $129.99 × 66,389,673 = $8,629,993,593.27 ≈ $8,629.99 million (or $8.63 billion).\n \n 3) Pull debt, cash, and noncontrolling interests from the latest balance sheet to compute Net Debt and then Enterprise Value (EV).\n - Long‑term debt (2025‑09‑30): $4,780.0 million; Current maturities of long‑term debt: $5.4 million. Total debt = $4,785.4 million. Cash & cash equivalents (2025‑09‑30): $400.0 million. Noncontrolling interests (2025‑09‑30): $8.8 million. (All from Q3 2025 10‑Q condensed balance sheet.)\n - Net Debt = Total Debt − Cash = $4,785.4 − $400.0 = $4,385.4 million.\n - EV formula and calculation (USD):\n  EV = Market Cap + Net Debt + Noncontrolling Interests\n  = $8,629.99 + $4,385.40 + $8.80 = $13,024.19 million (≈ $13.02 billion).\n \n 4) Build TTM Sales (Q4’24 + 9M’25).\n - Q4 2024 net sales: $1,461.1 million (company press release dated 2025‑02‑05).\n - 9M 2025 net sales (through 2025‑09‑30): $4,411.2 million (Q3 2025 10‑Q, table “Net Sales Nine Months Ended Sep 30, 2025 … Total Regal Rexnord”).\n - TTM Sales = $1,461.1 + $4,411.2 = $5,872.3 million.\n \n 5) Build TTM EBITDA via GAAP components (Q4’24 + 9M’25), explicitly deriving Q4’24 EBITDA from FY’24 minus 9M’24.\n - FY 2024 Income from Operations = $630.0 million (Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss), 2024 10‑K).\n - FY 2024 Depreciation = $165.3 million; FY 2024 Amortization = $346.5 million (Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, 2024 10‑K). Thus FY 2024 D&A = $511.8 million; FY 2024 EBITDA = $630.0 + $511.8 = $1,141.8 million.\n - 9M 2024 Income from Operations = $501.9 million; 9M 2024 Amortization = $260.0 million; 9M 2024 Depreciation = $122.6 million (segment “Other Supplemental Disclosures” tables, Q3 2025 10‑Q, prior‑year columns). Thus 9M 2024 D&A = $382.6 million; 9M 2024 EBITDA = $501.9 + $382.6 = $884.5 million.\n - Q4 2024 EBITDA = FY 2024 EBITDA − 9M 2024 EBITDA = $1,141.8 − $884.5 = $257.3 million.\n - 9M 2025 Income from Operations = $516.3 million; 9M 2025 Amortization = $259.5 million; 9M 2025 Depreciation = $117.5 million (same Q3 2025 10‑Q tables, current‑year columns). Thus 9M 2025 D&A = $377.0 million; 9M 2025 EBITDA = $516.3 + $377.0 = $893.3 million.\n - TTM EBITDA = Q4 2024 EBITDA + 9M 2025 EBITDA = $257.3 + $893.3 = $1,150.6 million.\n \n 6) Compute EV/Sales using EV (Step 3) and TTM Sales (Step 4).\n - Formula: EV/Sales = EV ÷ TTM Sales.\n - Calculation: $13,024.19 ÷ $5,872.30 = 2.22× (rounded to 2 decimals).\n \n 7) Compute EV/EBITDA using EV (Step 3) and TTM EBITDA (Step 5).\n - Formula: EV/EBITDA = EV ÷ TTM EBITDA.\n - Calculation: $13,024.19 ÷ $1,150.60 = 11.32× (rounded to 2 decimals).\n \n 8) Compute TTM diluted EPS and P/E using the specified date’s price.\n - Gather last four quarterly diluted EPS:\n  • Q4 2024 diluted EPS = $0.62 (press release 2025‑02‑05).\n  • Q1 2025 diluted EPS = $0.86 (press release 2025‑05‑05).\n  • Q2 2025 diluted EPS = $1.19 (press release 2025‑08‑05).\n  • Q3 2025 diluted EPS = $1.20 (press release 2025‑10‑29).\n - TTM diluted EPS = 0.62 + 0.86 + 1.19 + 1.20 = $3.87.\n - P/E formula: Price ÷ TTM diluted EPS.\n - Calculation at 2025‑11‑18 close: $129.99 ÷ $3.87 = 33.59× (rounded to 2 decimals).\n \n 9) Report the final valuation multiples (all as of 2025‑11‑18, USD; EV built from 2025‑09‑30 balance sheet; TTM period ended 2025‑09‑30; see Steps 2–8 for sourcing and calculations).\n - EV/EBITDA = 11.32×.\n - EV/Sales = 2.22×.\n - P/E = 33.59×.\n \n 10) Note key assumptions and any potential sources of variance.\n - Shares outstanding used for Market Cap reflect the Q3 2025 10‑Q figure “as of 2025‑10‑27”; no material share count change between 2025‑10‑27 and 2025‑11‑18 is assumed. EBITDA is a non‑GAAP construct here (OI + D&A) built solely from GAAP line items; alternative “Adjusted EBITDA” disclosed in press releases is not used in these calculations. These assumptions can affect results marginally versus other data providers’ definitions.",
