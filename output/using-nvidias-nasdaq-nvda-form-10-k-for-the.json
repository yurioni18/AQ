Pull Nvidia's FY 2025 D&A (depreciation & amortization): $1,864 million (Form 10-K, FY 2025).\n \n 3. Calculate Nvidia's FY 2025 EBITDA as EBIT plus D&A: $81,453 million + $1,864 million = $83,317 million.\n \n 4. Pull Nvidia's total shares outstanding from the balance sheet \"24,477 shares issued and outstanding as of January 26, 2025\": 24,477 million (Form 10-K, FY 2025).\n \n 5. Pull Nvidia's latest close price before end of FY 2025: $142.59/share (Yahoo Finance, closing share price on January 24, 2025).\n \n 6. Calculate nvidia's market cap at FY 2025 end as total shares outstanding multiplied by latest close price: 24,477 million shares × $142.59/share = $3,490,175.43 million. \n \n 7.

Calculate Enterprise Value (EV) as market cap plus total debt minus cash &cash equivalents minus marketable securities: $3,490,175.43 million + $8,463 million − $8,589 million - $34,621 million = $3,455,428.43 million.\n \n 11. Calculate FY 2025 EV/EBITDA as EV divided by EBITDA: $3,455,428.43 million ÷ $83,317 million = 41.47x.",
