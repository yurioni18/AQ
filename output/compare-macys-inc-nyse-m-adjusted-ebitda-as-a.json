  "title": "Compare Macy's Inc. (NYSE: M) adjusted EBITDA as a percent of total revenue in FY 2025 (ended Feb 1st, 2025), against guidance in Q2 2024 after adjusting for delivery expense. Use the midpoint value and report it as % BEAT or MISS (rounded to two decimal points).",
  "description": "1. Compute the actual FY 2025 (ended Feb 1st, 2025) adjusted EBITDA margin. Using the Macy's Form 10-K (ended Feb 1st, 2024), find Adjusted EBITDA = $1977 million and Total Revenue = $23,006 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin = ($1977m/$23,006m) x 100 = 8.59% (rounded to two decimals).\n \n 2. Find Q2 2024 guidance, adjusted for delivery expense, using the figure reported on Macy's Q3 report. Guidance for FY 2025 Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of total revenue: 8.2%–8.7%. Midpoint of the values = (8.2% + 8.7%)/2 = 8.45%.\n \n 3. Compare the actual and guided midpoint: 8.59% − 8.45% = 0.14%. Report BEAT or MISS: 0.14% BEAT.",
