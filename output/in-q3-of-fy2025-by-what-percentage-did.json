  "title": "In Q3 of FY2025, by what percentage did CrowdStrike beat or miss on the midpoint of its guidance range for non-GAAP diluted EPS? Use guidance that was provided on a quarterly basis. Provide your answer in %. Round to two decimal places.",
  "description": "1. Find Q3 FY2025 quarterly guidance for non-GAAP diluted EPS, which was between $0.80-$0.81 per share and issued during Q2 FY2025 financial results\n \n 2. Calculate the midpoint of guidance, which is ($0.80 + $0.81) / 2 = $0.805 per share\n \n 3. Find actual Q3 FY2025 non-GAAP diluted EPS, which was $0.93 per share\n \n 4. Calculate whether CrowdStrike beat or miss compared to the guidance midpoint. Use the following calculation: [($0.93 − $0.805) / $0.805] x 100 = Beat by 15.53%",
