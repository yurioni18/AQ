  "description": "1) Identify the base and end points from Tesla'a FY 2024 10-k graph titled \" Comparison of 60 Months Cumulative Total Return. It compares cumulative total return assuming $100 invested on January 1, 2020 and measured through December 31, 2024 (i.e., base period Dec-19 to Dec-24.\n \n 2) Retrive the start and end points in the graph which is $100 for Dec-19 and 1447.97 for Dec-24\n \n 4) Compute the 5‑year CAGR from Dec‑19 to Dec‑24: CAGR = ( 1447.97 / 100)^(1/5) − 1 = (14.479741842954462)^(1/5) − 1 = 70.6680% per year.

[calculation]\n \n 6) Convert projected Index_2028 to cumulative return vs. the $100 base: Cum. return_2028 = 12,284.84 − 100 = 12,184.84%, which rounds to 12,185%. [calculation]",
