  "title": "Using Fortrea’s FY2024 (FTRE) Form 10-K, analyze how the company’s business composition and working-capital profile have evolved:\n a) Compute revenue mix by geography (North America, Europe, Other) for 2022, 2023, 2024 and express each region’s % of total revenue.\n b) Compute each region’s percentage-point change in mix from 2022 → 2024.\n c) Compute the 2-year CAGR (2022→2024) for each region and total company.\n d) Using the contracts note, compute Fortrea’s net contract asset/(liability) position as a % of revenue for 2023 and 2024, where net = (Accounts receivable + Unbilled services − Allowance for credit losses − Unearned revenue).\n e) Compute an AR+Unbilled DSO equivalent (days) for 2023 and 2024: ((Accounts receivable + Unbilled services) / Revenue) × 365.\n f) Provide one sentence interpreting the mix and working-capital trend.",
  "description": "Using FTRE 24FY 10-K I would start by only using cont operations, all figures in USD, and the Fortrea FY2024 Form 10-K as the sole source. Percentages will be rounded to 2 decimals and days to 1 decimal. For comparisons, I’ll would only look to reported fiscal-year totals and apply formulas consistently across 2022–2024.\n \n Start with pulling the geography revenue table and transcribe the three-year series. From the Income Statement + the MD&A geography disclosure, record revenues for North America, Europe, Other, plus Total for each year. Transcribed values: 2022 for NA $1,415.5M, EU $841.9M, Other $579.6M, Total $2,837.0M; 2023 for NA $1,398.4M, EU $827.5M, Other $616.6M, Total $2,842.5M; 2024 for NA $1,269.5M, EU $800.0M, Other $626.9M, Total $2,696.4M. If the table is in thousands, I convert to $Milly consistently.\n \n Define the mix formula and compute each year’s composition. Region mix %age = (Region revenue ÷ Total revenue). Using the transcribed series: 2022 for NA 49.89%, EU 29.68%, Other 20.43%; 2023 for NA 49.20%, EU 29.11%, Other 21.69%. 2024 for NA 47.08%, EU 29.67%, Other 23.25%. To wanity check: each year’s three percentages should sum to about 100% in some cases where this minute kind of differ.\n \n Measure how composition shifted from 2022 to 2024.\n difference or delta mix (percentage points) = Mix %age ('24) − Mix %age (22). Results record as: NA for 2.81 p.p., EU −0.01 p.p., Other +2.82 p.p.; Interpreting direction: North America share edged down, “Other” picked up almost the exact offset, Europe was essentially flat.\n \n Quantify growth/decline with a two-year CAGR for each region and total.\n CAGR = (Value in 2024 / Value 2022)^(1/2) − 1. Plugging the level data:\n • NA: (1,269.5 / 1,415.5)^(1/2) − 1 = −5.30%.\n • EU: (800.0 / 841.9)^(1/2) − 1 = −2.52%.\n • Other: (626.9 / 579.6)^(1/2) − 1 = +4.00%.\n • Total: (2,696.4 / 2,837.0)^(1/2) − 1 = −2.51%.\n Directionally, the declines in NA/EU and modest total contraction line up with the raw levels.\n \n \n Collect the contract-related working-capital lines (for 2023 and 2024).\n From the contracts/balance note, capture Accounts receivable (AR), Unbilled services, Allowance for credit losses, Unearned revenue:\n • 2023 → AR $420.2M, Unbilled $600.0M, Allowance $31.7M, Unearned $214.2M.\n • 2024 → AR $156.5M, Unbilled $542.3M, Allowance $39.3M, Unearned $353.3M.\n These will feed both the net contract position and DSO equivalents.\n \n Compute the net contract asset/(liability) intensity versus revenue.\n Net contract position = AR + Unbilled − Allowance − Unearned; then % of revenue = Net ÷ Revenue.\n • 2023 → (420.2 + 600.0 − 31.7 − 214.2) / 2,842.5 = 27.24%.\n 2024 → (156.5 + 542.3 − 39.3 − 353.3) / 2,696.4 = 11.36%.\n Positive values indicate a net contract asset; if negative, it would indicate a net contract liability position.\n \n To measure cash conversion, convert AR+Unbilled into a DSO-style metric.\n AR + Unbilled DSO (days) = (AR + Unbilled) × Annual revenue × 365.\n 2023: (420.2 + 600.0) / 2,842.5 × 365 = 131.0 days.\n 2024: (156.5 + 542.3) / 2,696.4 × 365 = 94.6 days.\n Tighter billing and/or quicker bill-to-cash conversion are suggested by this decrease of about 36 days, which is consistent with the drop in the net contract asset percentage.5",
