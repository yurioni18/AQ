  "description": "1. Calculate the Enterprise Value using EV = market capitalization + total debt - cash and cash equivalents \n \n 2. Extract common shares outstanding = 1,074M, short-term debt = $0M, long-term debt = $14,811M, total debt = $14,811M, and cash and cash equivalents = $5,520M \n \n 3. Add short-term and long-term debt to get total debt = $14,811M \n \n 4. Calculate market capitalization = $169.2 * 1074 = $181,720.8M \n \n 5. Use the formula to calculate EV = $191,011.8M ($181,720.8 + $14,811 - $5,520) \n \n 6. Calculate EBITDA using EBITDA = net income + interest + tax + depreciation & amortization - investment and other income\n \n 7. Extract net income = $5,541M, interest = $664M, tax = $7,122, depreciation and amortization = $1,602M, investment and other income = $972M. Use the formula in step 7 to calculate EBITDA = $13,957M. \n \n 8. Calculate EV/EBITDA = $191,011.8M/$13,957M = 13.69x \n \n 9. From the 10-K Filing: Extract revenue = $44,284 \n \n 10. Calculate EV/Revenue = $191,011.8M/$44,284M = 4.31x",
