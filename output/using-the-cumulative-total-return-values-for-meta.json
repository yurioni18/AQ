(META) shown in the chart of the 10-k report, calculate the total percentage-point increase in Meta's return from its lowest point in 2022 to its highest point in 2024. Report your final answer as a single number in percentage points.",
  "description": "1) Retrieve META’s “Stock Performance Graph” from the FY 2024 Form 10-K and read Meta’s cumulative total return values at the specified year-end points. The graph is indexed to $100 at 12/31/2019; Meta’s plotted value is at its 2022 low near $60 at 12/31/2022 and at its 2024 high near $290 at 12/31/2024. Note: the 10-K presents a graph (image) without a numeric table, so values are read directly from the chart. (Meta Platforms, Inc., Form 10-K for year ended Dec. 31, 2024, “Stock Performance Graph.”)\n \n 2)Identify the values at Dec 2022 and Dec 2024 which is $60 and $290 respectively.\n \n 3) Compute the percentage-point increase from the 2022 low to the 2024 high: 290 − 60 = 230 percentage points.",
