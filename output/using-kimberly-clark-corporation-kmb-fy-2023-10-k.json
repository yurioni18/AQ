  "title": "Using Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB) FY 2023 10-K and FY 2020 10-K, what was the percentage change in Return on Equity (ROE) between FY 2020 and FY 2023?\n Express your answer as a percentage rounded to 2 decimals.",
  "description": "1. Determine the equations needed. ROE = Net income attributable to Kimberly-Clark Corporation ÷ average Kimberly-Clark Corporation stockholders’ equity (beginning and ending of the fiscal year, excluding noncontrolling interests). The percentage change between 2023 ROE and 2020 ROE = ((ROE 2023 − ROE 2020) ÷ ROE 2020) × 100.\n \n 2. Determine net income attributable to Kimberly-Clark Corporation. Looking at the 2020 10-K Consolidated Income Statements, we see that FY 2020 Net Income = $2,352 million. Looking at the 2023 10-K Consolidated Income Statements, we see that FY 2023 Net Income = $1,764 million. \n \n 3. Record Kimberly-Clark Corporation stockholders’ equity (ending balances). Looking at the 2020 10-K Consolidated Income Statements, we see that FY 2019 = -$33 million and FY 2020 = $626 million. Looking at the 2023 10-K Consolidated Income Statements, we see that FY 2022 = $547 million; FY 2023 = $915 million. \n \n 4. Compute FY 2020 average equity and ROE: Average equity 2020 = (-$33 + $626) ÷ 2 = $296.50 million. ROE 2020 = $2,352 ÷ $296.50 = 7.9325. \n \n 5. Compute FY 2023 average equity and ROE: Average equity 2023 = ($547 + $915) ÷ 2 = $731.00 million. ROE 2023 = $1,764 ÷ $731.00 = 2.4131. \n \n 6. Compute the percentage change in ROE from FY 2020 to FY 2023. Using the formula determined in step 1, we find that percentage change in ROE = ((2.4131 − 7.9325) ÷ 7.9325) × 100 = -69.58%.",
