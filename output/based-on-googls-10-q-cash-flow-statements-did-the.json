  "description": "One first needs to extract H1 and Q1 figures for both FY2024 nad FY2025. Obtain Q2 figures for both fiscal years by differencing. Calculate the FCF conversion % by dividing CF by the company-reported Net Income to Common.\n \n FY2025\n \n H1 OCF = 63,897\n H1 CapEx = 39,643\n Q1 OCF = 36,150\n Q1 CapEx = 17,197\n Q2 OCF = 63,897 − 36,150 = 27,747\n Q2 CapEx = 39,643 − 17,197 = 22,446\n Q2 FCF (’25) = 27,747 − 22,446 = 5,301\n Q2 Net income to common = 28,196\n \n Q2-FY2025 FCF conversion = 5,301 / 28,196 = 18.80%\n \n FY2024\n \n H1 OCF = 55,488\n H1 CapEx = 25,198\n Q1 OCF = 28,848\n Q1 CapEx = 12,012\n Q2 OCF = 55,488 − 28,848 = 26,640\n Q2 CapEx = 25,198 − 12,012 = 13,186\n Q2 FCF (’24) = 26,640 − 13,186 = 13,454\n \n Q2 Net income to common = 23,619\n \n Q2-FY2024 FCF conversion = 13,454 / 23,619 = 56.96%\n \n YoY change (Q2-25 vs Q2-24)\n \n 18.80% − 56.96% = −38.16 percentage points\n \n Conclude that FCF conversion worsened by 38.16%.",
