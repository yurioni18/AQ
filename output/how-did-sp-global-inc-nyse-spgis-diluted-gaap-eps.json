  "title": "How did S&P Global Inc (NYSE: SPGI)'s diluted GAAP EPS compare to management projections (at midpoint) on an annual basis in 2024? Format as % BEAT or MISS and express answer with two decimal points. Use guidance provided on an annual basis.",
  "description": "First, you have to find the actual FY 2024 diluted GAAP EPS, which is $12.35 per share \n \n Next, you have to find the latest FY 2024 annual GAAP diluted EPS guidance and then use that guidance to find the midpoint\n - The guidance range that was given in the 3Q 2024 report was $11.95 to $12.15\n - Therefore, the midpoint is ($11.95 + $12.15)/2 = $12.05 per share\n \n Finally, you have to calculate percent beat vs guidance at midpoint: (12.35 − 12.05) / 12.05 = 0.30 / 12.05 = 2.49%, which represents a 2.49% BEAT",
  "answer": "2.49% BEAT",
