If NSC achieves UNP's operating ratio post-merger, estimate the incremental operating income NSC would generate (using NSC's FY 2024 revenue as the base). Express in $M rounded to 0 decimal places.\n The S-4 projects $2.75B in annual synergies. What percentage of NSC's FY 2024 operating income do these synergies represent? Round to 1 decimal place.\n Based on the $320/share offer and the 25% premium cited, calculate NSC's implied 30-day VWAP as of July 16, 2025. Round to 2 decimal places.\n \n Format answer as:\n \n Operating Ratio Spread: [X.X] percentage points\n Incremental Operating Income at UNP Efficiency: $[X]M\n Synergies as % of NSC Operating Income: [X.X]%\n Implied NSC 30-day VWAP: $[X.XX]"
