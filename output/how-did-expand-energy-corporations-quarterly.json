  "title": "How did Expand Energy Corporation's quarterly Capex figures (excluding the productive capacity program) compare to management guidance (at midpoint) for the last 3 quarters. Use guidance from the previous quarter's management guidance when comparing and format answer as % Beat or % Miss with a beat representing actual capex being lower and vice-versa for a miss. Round percentage to 2 decimal places.",
  "description": "1. Identify the necessary formula to determine the beat or miss of actual compared to guided figures. For this question, it is: (Actual Figure/Guided Figure)-1 with the output being expressed as a percentage out to two decimal places\n 2. Determine the formula needed to find the midpoint in management guidance which is (upper bound of guidance + lower bound of guidance)/2\n \n 3. Retrieve Q1 2025 actual (denoted as 1Q25A) Total Base Capital Expenditures from the Q1 2025 Outlook document: $662\n 4. Retrieve and calculate the midpoint of Q1 2025 guided (denoted as 1Q25E) Total Base Capital Expenditures from the Q4 2024 Outlook document: $712.5 = (675+750)/2\n 5. Compute the % Beat or % Miss for Q1 2025 according to the formula stated in step 1: -7.09% or 7.09% Beat = 662/712.5-1\n \n 6. Retrieve Q2 2025 actual (denoted as 2Q25A) Total Base Capital Expenditures from the Q2 2025 Outlook document : $655\n 7. Retrieve and calculate the midpoint of Q2 2025 guided (denoted as 2Q25E) Total Base Capital Expenditures from the Q1 2025 Outlook document: $762.5 = (725+800)/2\n 8. Compute the % Beat or % Miss for Q2 2025 according to the formula stated in step 1: -14.10% or 14.10% Beat = 655/762.5-1\n \n 9. Retrieve Q3 2025 actual (denoted as 3Q25A) Total Base Capital Expenditures from the Q3 2025 Outlook document: $635 \n 10. Retrieve and calculate the midpoint of Q3 2025 guided (denoted as 3Q25E) Total Base Capital Expenditures from the Q2 2025 Outlook document: $700 = (660+740)/2\n 11. Compute the % Beat or % Miss for Q3 2025 according to the formula stated in step 1: -9.29% or 9.29% Beat = 635/700-1",
  "answer": "Q3 2025: 9.29% Beat; Q2 2025: 14.10% Beat; Q1 2025: 7.09% Beat",
