  "description": "1. Identify FY2024 net sales from Dillard’s FY2024 Form 10-K (fiscal year ended February 1, 2025): Net sales = $6,482.636 million.\n \n 2. Gather EV inputs from the FY2024 Form 10-K balance sheet disclosures (as of February 1, 2025): \n long-term debt = $321.567 million; \n Subordinated debentures = $200 mln; \n cash and cash equivalents = $717.854 mln; \n short-term investments = $325.675 million; \n no preferred stock or noncontrolling interests are presented on the consolidated balance sheet (treated as $0 in EV).\n \n 3. Compute enterprise value using the provided equity value: \n EV = Market cap ($10,000.0 million) + Total debt ($521.6 million) − Cash and short-term investments ($1,043.5 million) = $9,478.1 million.\n \n 4. Calculate EV/Sales and round to two decimals: EV/Sales = $9,478.1 million ÷ $6,482.636 million = 1.46x.",
