  "title": "How much would 2005’s Cash from Operations have been if Citrix (CTXS) had instead classified its Available for Sale Securities as Trading Securities? Express the answer in $M rounded to 2 decimal places of precision.",
  "description": "1. Apply the GAAP reclassification rule. If securities are classified as trading, related cash receipts and payments are classified as operating cash flows. To restate 2005 CFO as if it were trading securities, you need to reclassify the period’s AFS purchases, sales, and maturities from investing to operating.\n \n 2. Extract reported 2005 figures from Citrix 10-K for FY 2006. Important figures to pull are Net cash provided by operating activities (CFO) = $293,143, Purchases of available-for-sale investments = $(183,245), Proceeds from sales of available-for-sale investments = $396,580, Proceeds from maturities of available-for-sale investments = $141,652.\n \n 3. Compute reclassification and revised CFO for 2005: Net AFS cash inflow to move to operating = 396,580 + 141,652 − 183,245 = 354,987; Adjusted CFO = reported CFO + net AFS inflow = 293,143 + 354,987 = 648,130\n \n 4. Round to two decimals = $648.13M",
