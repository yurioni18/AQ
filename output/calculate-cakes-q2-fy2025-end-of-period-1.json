  "description": "1. Recognize CAKE's comparable restaurants convention. \"Restaurants enter comps in their 19th month of operation; relocated and closed restaurants are excluded from comps. Therefore, EOP comparable base = total reported EOP Q2-FY2025 The Cheesecake Factory restaurants - minus restaurants opened during the last 6 quarters.\n \n 2. Identify EOP The Cheesecake Factory restaurants open at Q2-FY2025: 216 restaurants.\n \n 3. Sum The Cheesecake Factory restaurants opened during the last six quarters:\n  - Q2-FY2025: 2; Q1-FY2025: 0; Q4-FY2024: 2; Q3-FY2024: 0; Q2-FY2024: 1; Q1-FY2024: 0\n \n Total openings = 5 restaurants. \n \n 4. EOP comparable restaurant base for The Cheesecake Factory segment: 216 − 5 = 211 restaurants.",
