  "title": "Based on GOOGL's 10-Qs, calculate the company's Q2-FY2025 FCF Conversion of Adjusted EBITDA. Define FCF as OCF - Capex. Adjust EBITDA by adding back SBC expense. Express your answer as a percentage, rounded to two decimal places.",
  "description": "1. Identify Q2-FY2025 Income from operations: $31271 millions.\n \n 2. Gather H2 and Q1 figures in USD millions and obtain Q2 figures by subtraction.\n \n H2 OFC = 63,897\n H2 Purchases of property and equipment = 39,643; \n H2 Depreciation of property and equipment = 9,485\n H2 Stock-based compensation expense= 11,514\n \n Q1 OFC = 36,150\n Q1 Purchases of property and equipment = 17,197\n Q1 Depreciation of property and equipment = 4,487\n Q1 Stock-based compensation expense = 5,516\n \n 3. Compute Q2 FY2025 figures:\n \n OCF Q2 = 63,897 − 36,150 = 27,747\n Capex Q2 = 39,643 − 17,197 = 22,446\n \n 4. Calculate Q2 FY2025 Free Cash Flow \n FCF Q2 = 27,747 − 22,446 = 5,301.\n \n 5. Calculate Q2 FY2025 EBITDA:\n \n Depreciation of property and equipment (DPE) Q2 = 9,485 − 4,487 = 4,998\n EBITDA Q2 = Income from operations Q2 + DPE Q2 = 31,271 + 4,998 = 36,269\n \n 6. Adjust EBITDA by adding back stock-based compensation (SBC): \n \n SBC Q2 = 11,514 − 5,516 = 5,998\n Adjusted EBITDA Q2 = 36,269 + 5,998 = 42,267\n \n 7. Compute Q2 FY2025 FCF Conversion of Adjusted EBITDA and round to two decimals: \n FCF Conversion = FCF Q2 ÷ Adjusted EBITDA Q2 = 5,301 ÷ 42,267 = 12.54%.",
