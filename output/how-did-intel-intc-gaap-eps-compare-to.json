  "title": "How did Intel (INTC) GAAP EPS compare to management’s guidance in each quarter of FY 2024? Format each as “Q[X] FY2024: [X.X]% BEAT/MISS”, rounded to 2 decimals. Use quarterly earnings releases.",
  "description": "1. Firstly, using comparison method: \n \n Here I have used the formula : Percent vs guidance = [(Actual GAAP EPS − Guided GAAP EPS) / |Guided GAAP EPS|] × 100;\n If Actual is greater than Guidance classify as BEAT otherwise MISS. \n I then rounded each of the absolute percentages to 2 decimal places.\n \n \n 2. Calculate Q1: Actual GAAP EPS = -$0.09 (Q1 FY2024 press release from Apr 25, 2024); \n Guidance for Q1 GAAP EPS = -$0.25 (Q4 FY2023 press release). \n Using formula previously stated : ((-0.09+0.25)/|-0.25|))*100 = 64.00% (absolute)\n Since −0.09 > −0.25, Q1 is a BEAT\n Q1 FY2024: 64.00% BEAT.\n \n 3. Derive Q2: Actual GAAP EPS = -$0.38 (Q2 FY2024 press release, Aug 1, 2024); Guidance for Q2 GAAP EPS = -$0.05 (Q1 FY2024 press release, Apr 25, 2024). \n Compute : ((-0.38+0.05)/|-0.05|)) x 100= 660.00% (absolute)\n Q2 FY2024: 660.00% MISS.\n \n 4.Compute Q3: Actual GAAP EPS = -$3.88 (Q3 FY2024 press release); \n Q3 Guidance GAAP EPS = -$0.24 (Q2 FY2024 press release, Aug 1, 2024). \n \n Calculate: ((-3.88+0.24)/|-0.24|))x100 = 1516.66667% (absolute)\n Actual is much worse than guidance (more negative), so we classify it as a MISS\n Q3 FY2024: 1516.67% MISS\n \n 5.Compute Q4: Actual GAAP EPS = -$0.03 (Q4 FY2024 press release)\n \n Guidance for Q4 GAAP EPS = -$0.24 (Q3 FY2024 press release). \n Compute : ((-0.03+0.24)/|-0.24|)) x 100= 87.50% (absolute)\n Actual is higher than guidance therefore a BEAT \n Q4 FY2024: 87.50% BEAT\n \n 6. Lastly, we display answer as (all to 2 decimal places):\n \n Q1 FY2024: 64.00% BEAT\n Q2 FY2024: 660.00% MISS\n Q3 FY2024: 1516.67% MISS\n Q4 FY2024: 87.50% BEAT",
