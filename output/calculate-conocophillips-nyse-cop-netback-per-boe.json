  "description": "1. Calculate FY 2024 operating netback per BOE as Netback/BOE= Realized price / BOE - (production and operation expenses + taxes other than income taxes)/BOE. \n \n 2. Find consolidated realized prices as crude oil = $76.74/bbl, NGL =$22.43/bbl, bitumen=$47.92/bbl, natural gas = $2.61/mcf. \n \n 3. Use a 6:1 mcf to BOE conversion as management states. \n \n 4. Collect production rates and compute total BOE. Find Crude at 969 MBD, NGL at 304 MBD, bitumen at 122 MBD, gas at 2200 MMCFD. Calculate BOE as (969+304+122+2200/6) * 366 days = 644.77 million. \n \n 5. Calculated the consolidated realized price per BOE weighted by volume = ((354,654 mbbl* 76.74)+(111,264 mbbl*22.43)+(44652*47.92)+(805200*2.61))/644.77 mmboe = $52.66/BOE\n \n 6. Find the FY 2024 consolidated costs = production & operating expenses = 8751; taxes other than income taxes = $2087. Calculate the cost per BOE as (8751+2087)/644.77mm=$16.81/BOE\n \n 7. Calculate the FY 2024 netback per BOE as 52.66-16.81=$35.85 per BOE",
