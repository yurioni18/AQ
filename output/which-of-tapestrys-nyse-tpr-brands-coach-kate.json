  "description": "1) Find Tapestry's average square footage by brand for fiscal years 2022 and 2024.

Using Tapestry's 2024 10-K and its \"store count\" table: \n Coach 2022: 343\n Coach 2024: 324 \n Kate Spade 2022: 207\n Kate Spade 2024: 197\n Stuart Weitzman 2022: 39\n Stuart Weitzman 2024: 34\n \n 3) Calculate Tapestry's total square footage by brand for fiscal years 2022 and 2024 by multiplying average square footage by store count for each respective brand and year. \n Coach 2022: 4,839 x 343 = 1,659,777\n Coach 2024: 4,905 x 324 = 1,589,220\n Kate Spade 2022: 2,863 x 207 = 592,641\n Kate Spade 2024: 2949 x 197 = 580,953\n Stuart Weitzman 2022: 1,919 x 39 = 74,841\n Stuart Weitzman 2024: 1,938 x 34 = 65,892\n \n 4) Calculate the difference in total square footage between FY 2022 and FY 2024 for each of Tapestry's brands. \n Coach: 1,589,220 - 1,659,777 = - 70,557\n Kate Spade: 580,953 - 592,641 = -11,688\n Stuart Weitzman: 65,892 - 74,841 = -8,949\n \n 5) Identify the brand with the greatest growth in total square footage from FY 2022 to FY 2024. In this case, since all 3 brands saw a decline in total square footage, choose the brand with the smallest decline. Final answer: \"Stuart Weitzman; -8,949 sq ft\".",
