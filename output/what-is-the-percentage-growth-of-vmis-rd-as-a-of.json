  "title": "What is the percentage growth of VMI's R&D as a % of Product Sales from FY2023 to FY2024? Format answer as a % with two decimal places.",
  "description": "1. Use VMI's 10-K to find FY2023 and FY2024 inputs for R&D expenses, which are 55,000 thousand and 59,000 thousand, respectively.\n \n 2. Use Valmont's 10-K to find FY2023 and FY2024 inputs for Product Sales, which are 3,772,835 thousand and 3,660,779 thousand, respectively.\n \n 3. Using inputs from steps 1 and 2, calculate R&D as a % of Product Sales for each year: FY2023 = 55,000/3,772,835 = 1.4578% and FY2024 = 59,000/3,660,779 = 1.6117%.\n \n 4. Calculate percentage growth of the ratio from FY2023 to FY2024: ((1.6117%-1.4578%) / 1.4578%) x 100 = 10.56%",
