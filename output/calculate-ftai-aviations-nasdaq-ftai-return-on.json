  "title": "Calculate FTAI aviation's (NASDAQ: FTAI) return on capital during FY 2024. Express the answer as a percentage rounded to two decimal points of precision (ex: X.XX%).",
  "description": "Before examining the 10-K for the company FTAI, start by defining both the metric and formula: Compute return on capital (ROIC) as NOPAT divided by average invested capital for the fiscal year of 2024 (EOY December 31, 2024). \n \n To get NOPAT calculate the EBIT × (1 − effective tax rate), where EBIT = operating income from the consolidated statement of operations; effective tax rate = provision for income taxes divided by the income before income taxes. \n Define invested capital = total debt (gross, i.e., bonds payable) + total equity − cash and cash equivalents, and compute this average as the mean of 12/31/2023 and 12/31/2024 for the fiscal year of '24\n \n These defined formulas should be the continuing frameworks for the inputs to be found and recorded.\n \n To get the inputs from the 10-K look at the Consolidated Statement of Operations, and extract FY 2024 operating and tax inputs in thousands of USD:\n \n Total revenues should be recorded as $1,734,901K, while total expenses are $1,497,074K so netting the two gives an EBIT of $237,827K. \n FY 2024 income before income taxes = 14,169; provision for income taxes = 5,487; effective tax rate = 5,487 ÷ 14,169 = 38.73%. \n \n Compute NOPAT for FY 2024: NOPAT = EBIT × (1 − effective tax rate) = 237,827 × (1 − 0.3873) = 145,727.6 (USD thousands). \n  \n Examining the bonds payable table balance sheet for total bonds payable, equity and cash & cash equivalents, compute invested capital at 12/31/2024 and 12/31/2023 (USD thousands): 2024 invested capital = total debt (gross bonds payable) 3,496,004 + total equity 81,368 − cash and cash equivalents 115,116 = 3,462,256; 2023 invested capital = 2,550,493 + 175,883 − 90,756 = 2,635,620. \n \n Average invested capital and compute ROC: Average invested capital = (3,462,256 + 2,635,620) ÷ 2 = 3,048,938 (USD thousands). ROC = NOPAT ÷ average invested capital = 145,727.6 ÷ 3,048,938 = 4.78% for FY 2024.",
